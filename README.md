# Model-Diagnostics

Model diagnostics are heavily utilised when creating data science models. It's crucial to comprehend the principles of simple models before diving into the details of complex ones.This blog is dedicated to doing model diagnostics using a straightforward model, such as linear regression. Before moving on to diagnostics, we'll try to understand the assumptions of a simple linear regression. We won't go through the mathematical ideas in detail; instead, we'll merely comprehend them so they can be put into practice utilising packages.

1. Homoscedasticity (Breusch-Pagan test)
2. Normality of residuals (Q-Q Plots)
3. Multicollinearity (Correlation Matrix / ViF)
4. Autocorrelation (Durbin-Watson test)
